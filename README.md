# Arduino-DS18B20-Reader-with-Excel-Logging
This project is an Arduino code that detects how many DS18B20 sensors are connected to the board and receives the reading of all sensors to an excel sheet in a fixed delay. The project is useful for anyone who wants to monitor multiple temperature sensors and log the data to an excel sheet.
